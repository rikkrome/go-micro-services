# Go Micro Services

My goal for this repository is to build multiple microservices in Golang using a single codebase. UsingÂ [Standard Golang Project Layout](https://github.com/golang-standards/project-layout) 

## Get Setup
```
go work init
go work use ./services/auth-service
```

# podman
Start the podman server
```
podman machine start
```

Load compose
```
podman-compose -f compose.yaml up -d
```
